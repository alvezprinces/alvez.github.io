            <p>As the world turns into modernization, all the things it consists adopt its innovation and use what it offers for us to grow and produce efficient products.  Educational technology plays a pivotal role in modern teaching, serving as a bridge between traditional instructional methods and the dynamic digital world that students are part of.  </p>
                
            <p>As an educator, it is one of the greatest challenges for us to equip ourselves on how our learners learn and what world/generation they are in to. Todayâ€™s generation of learners are full of knowledge on using technology, easily bored and eager with what gives them excitement. In our part, it is our duty to give our students the diverse way of learning and of course technology could easily supply these needs. Attending this free training given by Northern Bukidnon State College gives me more confident in facing my learners by giving them more engaging activities, exciting presentations and website that could entrust learnings. Moreover, the knowledge I gained is much useful for me to complete my task as a teacher, inside and outside the classroom. This activity gives me so much to be thank for. Truly appreciate all the things I gained through out the training.
